# Welcome to My Writing Portfolio

This is a **test article** to demonstrate the new writing section powered by Decap CMS. 

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write articles in clean, readable markdown
- **Draft/Publish Workflow**: Control what's visible to visitors
- **Tags & Categories**: Organize content with metadata
- **Thumbnail Images**: Visual appeal for each article

## How It Works

1. Create articles locally via the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. The CMS saves markdown files to the `_articles/` folder
3. Run `npm run generate:manifest` to update the article list
4. Articles appear automatically on the writing page

This setup gives me complete control over my content while maintaining a professional publishing workflow.
