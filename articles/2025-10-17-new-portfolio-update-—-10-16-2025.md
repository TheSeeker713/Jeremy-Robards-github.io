### New Portfolio Update — 10-16-2025

Today marked a quiet yet meaningful turning point. I officially added a **Writing Samples** section to my portfolio, a space that will serve two purposes: showcasing my content and copywriting work, and demonstrating a practical example of how a CMS can be integrated in modern web development. This addition will not only strengthen the portfolio’s structure but also help potential clients see both technical and creative skill in action.

The rest of the day was deliberately slow. After last week’s exhausting trip, only minimal chores were done around the house. Rest and recovery still take priority, and it feels necessary before diving fully into new work.

Morning reflections from my journal capture the transition: I woke up around 7:30 AM, aware that this was supposed to be the first day of self-employed work — yet still tired, hesitant to start. By mid-morning, I revisited the three creative pillars: **A & J Studios** for video content, **Mycelia Interactive** for immersive media, and **DigiArtifact** for SaaS and gamified tools.
