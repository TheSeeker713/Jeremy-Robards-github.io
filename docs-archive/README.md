- **Deploy Main**: `npm run deploy`
- **Deploy Articles**: `npm run cms:publish`

## üìù Notes

- All archived documentation refers to systems that have been replaced
- The project has migrated from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages
- Decap CMS has been replaced with a custom TypeScript-based CMS
- The manifest.json system has been replaced with feed.json
- Two-project architecture: main site + articles (with worker proxy)

## üîÑ Migration Summary

**Before**: GitHub Pages + Decap CMS + manifest.json
**After**: Cloudflare Pages + Custom CMS + feed.json + Worker Proxy

The current system is more flexible, performant, and maintainable.
